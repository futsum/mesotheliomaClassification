 <h1 align = 'Center'>Prediction Model for Malignant Mesothelioma </h1>
 
According to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), a Malignant mesothelioma “is a neoplasm associated with occupational and environmental inhalation exposure to asbestos fibers and other elongate mineral particles (EMPs). The median survival of patients with malignant mesothelioma is about 1 year from the time they are diagnosed. Between 1999 to 2015, a total of 45,221 mesothelioma related deaths were recorded in the Unites States (Mazurek, Syamlal, Wood, Hendricks, & Weston, 2017).

It takes 20 to 40 years to develop a malignant mesothelioma from the time of exposure (Mazurek et al., 2017). As a result, mesothelioma is rare, and it is difficult to diagnosis; most patients diagnosed with mesothelioma when it is in advanced stage where treatment is less effective. Hence, early detection using patients’ clinical data is important (Ostroff et al., 2012). 

In this project, machine learning techniques will be used to predict patients with mesothelium. If patients with mesothelioma are identified early enough, medical experts can design proper treatment that can save the lives of their patients. 
R programming will be used for this project. Since the project is trying to predict patients with malignant mesothelioma, a classification method will be used. A learner will be trained using a patients’ clinical dataset. The first part of the project will focus on exploratory data analysis; in the second part, machine learning model will be built to predict patients with malignant mesothelioma. Both visual and non-visual analytical methods will be used to demonstrate the project. 

A clinical dataset from UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository will be used for this project. The dataset was prepared at Dicle University Faculty of Medicine in Turkey, and it was donated to UCI in 2016. It has 324 observations and 34 variables.
